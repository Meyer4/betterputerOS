BetterPuterOS is more than just a Linux distro. It’s a vision for computing that’s open, beautiful, powerful, and truly free for everyone.

We believe:
- Every user deserves great design, privacy, performance, and cloud convenience.
- Developers should have the best tools out of the box—no setup headaches.
- Gamers deserve native support and performance.
- The community is the heart of innovation—everyone can contribute.

Inspired by Mint, Zorin, and the best of open source, we’re building an OS you’ll love to use every day.
